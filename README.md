## Details

This Discord bot was developed using Java and leveraged the Discord API. A core feature was user management - allowing users to register with a unique code that was verified against a CSV file. This tied their Discord account to a profile record stored on the server.

The bot then had the ability to identify user test scores and placements based on their associated profile. Additional features included the ability to calculate exchange rates via a simple command interface.

Overall this project demonstrated skills in bot development using the Discord API as well as features related to user authentication, profile management, and basic calculations. The CSV integration showed ability to work with external data sources.
