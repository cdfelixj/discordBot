Hello

So for this assignment I have made 2 bots:
CoinBot
Currency

CoinBot:
The coin bot basically activates similarly to the ping bot
but activates when "flip coin" is said, in which it will just give heads or tails after saying it.

CurrencyBot:
This bot allows you to calculate the exchange to 4 different currencies which are USD, EUR, JPY or RMB.
it activates by using /exchange then choosing 1 to 4 amount of options and putting in the amount in HKD you want to see in the respective currencies.

You can go to the exampleofBot.png to see an example of it.
